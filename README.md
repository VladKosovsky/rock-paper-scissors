This is my take at building classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game as a website.

In the process of making it, i reinforced my knowledge in both HTML and CSS, and also more deeply learned how to use JavaScript functions and DOM.

Built with:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript
